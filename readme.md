-----

***TODO***

**First build**

* Finish horserun demo scene

**Second Build**

* Modify first horserun scene to be used as a template for new scenes 
* Multiple scenes
	* scenes have diferent background "music"
	* scenes to have a diferent theme
	* scenes to have diferent animals according to theme
* Create main menu and start screen
* Create options menu

**Future builds**

* Make animals animated and more fun rather than static
* Update scenery graphics
* Possible addons to be considered	
	* Allow player to control the main animal
	* Add "premium" additional animals and themes
	* Record scenes for playback or posting to facebook/youtube etc.
	* Look at advertising for free version of the game
